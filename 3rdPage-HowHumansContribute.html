			<p style="font-size:15px"> Several people in our world don't realize that their 
			actions can and will 
			have negative impacts on future generations. Specifically speaking, many 
			humans are depleting the ozone layer and are also creating large amounts of 
			ground-level ozone. Ozone depletion in the stratosphere is a major problem 
			that is often disregarded, and humans are the only one to blames for this 
			declination of ozone. Natural causes (sun spots) have been known to only 
			decrease 1%-2% of the ozone layer, however over 90% of depletion has been 
			connected to ozone depleting substances (ODS) created by human activities. The 
			chemicals chlorine and bromine (from manmade substances such as 
			chlorofluorocarbons) break down ozone, and they also remains in the atmosphere 
			for long periods of time. Chlorofluorocarbons are often released into the 
			stratosphere from aerosol cans, refrigerators, packing material, and cleaning 
			agents. On the bright side, CFCs have been banned. But on the dark side, they 
			still destroy the ozone layer. In fact, the ozone layer over Australia has 
			thinned, allowing harmful radiation to reach the surface of Earth. In addition, 
			ozone holes have formed over Antarctica. To continue, ground-level ozone only 
			forms when other substances created by humans react with normal ozone. 
			Nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds are the key ingredients in 
			making "bad" ozone. Nitrogen oxides are mostly released in the form of smog. 
			As the population increases, more and more cars are being used, ultimately 
			creating more nitrogen oxides. VOCs, short for volatile organic compounds, are 
			found in several products. Itâ€™s actually quite simple to reduce the amount of 
			VOCs in households. Humans just need to be more aware when buying products 
			from stores. Common sources of VOCs include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>New carpets or furniture</li> 
					<li>Paint</li> 
					<li>Nail polish</li> 
					<li>Hairspray</li> 
					<li>Fabric cleaners</li> 
					<li>Air fresheners</li>
					<li>Pesticides</li>
				</ul>
			<p style="font-size:15px"> Humans really needs to think about their actions and 
			how they might affect 
			the environment. Many people just don't realize that the products they are 
			buying aren't environmentally friendly. </p>
