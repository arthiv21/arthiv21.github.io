		<h2>What Is Ozone</h2>
			<p>Ozone is found in the atmosphere and at ground level. They are both have 
			the same chemical compound (O3) but are vastly different. Ozone that's formed
			in the stratosphere creates an ozone field that protects humans and other life
			from harmful UV rays. On the other hand, ground level ozone created in the 
			troposphere is harmful to humans.
