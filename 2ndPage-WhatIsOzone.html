		<h2>What Is Ozone</h2>
		<div class="stripe"></div>
		<div style="width: 800px; Height: 1000;">
			<p style="font-size:18px">Ozone is an inorganic chemical compound formed by 3 oxygen atoms, thus 
			having the chemical formula O3. Ozone is a gas that can be good or bad 
			depending on where it is found in Earth%27s atmosphere. O3 located in the 
			upper-atmosphere (stratosphere) is good, but O3 located in the 
			lower-atmosphere (troposphere) is bad. Do you know what shields you from the 
			harmful and dangerous UV rays from the sun? The ozone layer! It is a layer in 
			earth’s stratosphere containing large amounts of ozone that absorb ultraviolet
			radiation emitted by the sun. In fact, the ozone layer prevents 97%-99% of
			UV rays from damaging life on earth. Without the ozone layer humans,
			animals, plants, and basically any living organism would cease to exist. Even 
			tubes of sunscreen could not protect any life from the damaging radiation 
			given off by the sun. Although O3 in the stratosphere enables life to exist, 
			but ozone at surface level can do the exact opposite. When ozone at 
			ground-level is combined with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds 
			in the presence of sunlight, it becomes dangerous. It is highly unlikely to 
			completely get rid of all nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds 
			because they are emitted from most of the basic necessities in life. Nitrogen 
			oxides are gases composed of nitrogen and oxygen, commonly found in our 
			atmosphere. The main source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is smog from cars and 
			other vehicles. In addition, the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, 
			and gas release large amounts of NOx. To continue, volatile organic compounds 
			(VOC) must be present for “bad” ozone to form. VOCs are carbon based chemicals
			 that are used in several different products usually found in households. 
			 Common sources of VOCs include paint, moth balls, air fresheners, and 
			 pesticides.</p>
