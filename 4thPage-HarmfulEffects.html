		  <h3>The Danger Zone</h3>
			<p style="font-size:15px"> Ozone at ground-level is extremely dangerous to the 
			health of humans and other organisms. High levels of ozone increase the amount 
			of asthma attacks, aggravate lung disease, damage the lungs, shortness of 
			breath. Excessive amounts of ozone has even led to premature death. Several 
			studies have proven that as the amount of ozone increased, so did the amount 
			of death increase. </p>
