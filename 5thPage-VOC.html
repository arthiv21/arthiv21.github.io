		  <h3>Watch Out Plants!</h3>
			<p style="font-size:15px"> Not only does ozone hurt humans, but it also harms 
			plants. The United States Department of Agriculture even stated that 
			“ground-level ozone causes more damage to plants than all other air pollutants 
			combined”. Ozone enters plants through their stomata - pores that allow gas 
			exchange to occur. Once the ozone is inside the plant, it dissolves in water 
			and causes a series of problems for the plant. Plants grow slower since 
			photosynthesis is deterred, and energy production in the cell’s mitochondria 
			is hindered. </p>
		  
		  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
		  	<p style="font-size:15px"> Several plants clearly display symptoms of 
		  	overexposure to ozone. Common indications of ozone include: chlorosis - leaves 
		  	lose chlorophyll and become yellow, pale, or white, necrosis - leaves start to 
		  	turn black or brown because the plant tissue is dying, purpling - leaves start 
		  	to turn purple, or stippling - small, irregular, dark spots form on the 
		  	leaves. </p>
		  	
		  <h3>Experiment</h3>
		    <p style="font-size:15px"> There are several plants that can be used as 
		    bioindicators of ozone. I was curious to see how humans are killing plants by 
		    using toxic cleaning detergents around their house. Febreze is known to have 
		    over 70 air pollutants, so I tested how badly plants were affected by Febreze 
		    as compared to a homemade nontoxic cleaner.</p>
		  	
		  	  <h4>Procedure</h4>
		  	  	<ol>
		  	  		<li>Transfer the spinach plants to the cups</li>
		  	  		<li>Label the cups “Control 1”, “Control 2”, “VOC 1”, “VOC 2”, “Nontoxic 1”, and “Nontoxic 2”</li>
		  	  	</ol>
